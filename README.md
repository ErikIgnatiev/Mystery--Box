# Mystery-Box

Mystery-Box is a React.js demo for a real business case that is required by a friend of mine. 
The backend is run by an Express server connected to a MongoDB database.

## Installation

Both the server and the application need installation before initialization.

```bash
cd server/ npm install || yarn add
cd mystery-box/ npm install || yarn add
```

## Usage

```
cd server/ node index
cd mystery-box yarn start || npm start
```
